# CoronaKiller ðŸ¦ 
A complex (!) structured online and multiplayer 2D virus shooting game which lets you find your way up to the harsh levels and finally defeat the CoronaVirus King :blush:

## Get Started...
The game has a backend application, which has been deployed in http://144.122.71.144:8083/coronakillerbackend-group18/api on-prem server. Application is a SpringBoot application which covers frontend application's requirements since this is an online game. The deployed application may no longer be active (since this was a term project for an Undergraduate course in METU-CENG) therefore to test the application you would also need to build and run CoronaKillerBackend application.

The game also has a frontend application (as all you would guess :blush:) implemented as a JavaFX Application and managed within SpringBoot's Application Context (namely JavaFX + SpringBoot).

To actually build, run and start experiencing killing CoronaViruses please first consult to [backend documentation](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/CoronaKiller/tree/master/server/CoronaKillerBackend) then consult to [frontend documentation](https://github.com/ysyesilyurt/CoronaKiller/tree/master/client/CoronaKillerFrontend).

## ... Killing Corona?
Game's aim will be to eliminate as much Coronaviruses as possible (:blush:) throughout the different levels of the game using different types of guns. In the game one can play game, continue his/her last game, display different types of scoreboards and also play the game in multiplayer mode (only for the last level of the game).
